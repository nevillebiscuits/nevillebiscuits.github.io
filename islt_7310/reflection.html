        <h3>My Virtual Teaching Philosophy</h3>
        <p>Looking back on the whirlwind of the last 6 months, technology has become essential in the field of education. Teachers can no longer survive with just photocopies and textbooks. Even if the worldwide pandemic calms down and we return to “normal,” education cannot stay the same.</p> 
        <p>I believe that the students I am teaching are already digital natives. They have been using technology since they first got a hold of their parents’ smartphones. As a teacher, my job is to make sure they are using this technology in productive, creative, and ethical ways. They will look to me for guidance for their future success.</p> 
        <p>My colleagues also look to me for guidance with technology. Through my own research, I learned new techniques to support technology instruction and help students interact with lessons. What started as one-on-one help sessions with coworkers led to my leading workshops for the whole district. Recently, I expanded my professional development with formal training in Google Tools for Education, passing the Level 1 and Level 2 certification tests.</p>
        <p>As an English teacher, I am especially interested in helping my students use language to become better digital citizens in a world where they must produce and consume content. Looking forward, I will keep learning the newest methods for using technology in my content area. I also plan to pursue opportunities to coach other teachers across disciplines. Technology will not slow down, and educators need guidance to keep up with the digital natives who sit in their classrooms and who enroll in their online classes. A Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design with a Technology in Schools emphasis from the University of Missouri will equip me to teach my students and to coach my colleagues in this dynamic, technology-driven field of education.</p>
