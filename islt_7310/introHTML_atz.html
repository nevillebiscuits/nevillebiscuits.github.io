     Who am I?
My name is Elizabeth Atz. I live in Richmond Heights, Missouri with my husband and cat. Recently, I decided to take on a heroic task.  I signed up for 3 online grad classes while teaching virtually. Apparently, I just want to live in my office for the next 9 weeks. Who wants to interact with the outside world anyway right now? 

What do I do?
For the 9th year, I am teaching teenagers the value of reading and writing. August usually means I’m making copies and distributing highlighters. Tonight, however, I’m hanging up posters and bulletin boards in our spare bedroom. My classroom is now only a few steps from my kitchen. On Monday, I will see new faces in a Zoom grid.  My goal is to make a connection with each one of my students. This year will look different, but my job remains the same.
