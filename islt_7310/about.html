        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I attended <strong>East Noble High School</strong> in Indiana. There I achieved a 4.0, in addition to being the Editor in Chief of the yearbook. After high school, I went to <strong>Indiana Wesleyan University</strong> where I received a Bachelor of Science degree in English Education and graduated Magna Cum Laude.</p> 
        <h3>Professional Career</h3>
        <p>After college, I <em>returned</em> to <strong>East Noble</strong>, this time as a teacher. Here I gained experience in freshman, sophomore, and junior English, as well as AP Language and Creative Writing. In 2015 I moved to St. Louis and subbed for a year before being hired as an 8th grade ELA teacher at <strong>Parkway West Middle School</strong>. I teach there presently with an <em>amazing</em> group of educators.</p> 
        <h3>Continuing Education</h3>
        <p>Last spring, I began taking classes from <strong>The University of Missouri</strong>, seeking a Master of Science degree in Learning Technologies and Design with a Technology in Schools emphasis. I anticipate graduating in late 2021.</p>
