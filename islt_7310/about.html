<h3>Education</h3>

<h3>Professional Career</h3>

    <p>After college, I <em>returned</em> to <strong>East Noble</strong>, this time as a teacher. Here I gained experience in freshman, sophomore, and junior English, as well as AP Language and Creative Writing. In 2015 I moved to St. Louis and subbed for a year before being hired as an 8th grade ELA teacher at <strong>Parkway West Middle School</strong>. I teach there presently with an <em>amazing</em> group of educators.</p>
