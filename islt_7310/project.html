            <h2>1. Google Certification</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> In Summer 2019, I took a class designed to teach me advanced (Level 2) skills in Google Products for Education. I previously had achieved my Level 1 certification and now wanted to push myself further in this area. I studied for 2 months to learn more complex skills in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, Drive, Maps, Classroom, and Sites. After studying and following a practice course on Google Classroom, I took an online test and passed. I already knew some of the content, but I appreciated being exposed to specific tools and tips to streamline my day-to-day practices online in my teaching position.</p>
            <p><strong>Artifact:</strong> Certificate</p>
            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> At my school, I am known as one of the go-to people for technology help. I actually enjoy being able to teach my colleagues new skills that will ultimately make their lives easier. Whether it is conditional formatting on Google Sheets or Templates in Gmail, I am a resource for my colleagues.</p>

            <h2>2. Schoology</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> As many schools around the country weighed the options of in-person, virtual, or blended learning in the fall, my district ultimately chose to start fully online for the first quarter of the school year. District leaders also wanted a common platform for teachers, parents, and students, so Schoology was chosen for the LMS. While I was casually familiar with the platform, I was forced to become competent in a matter of weeks. I rapidly learned how to structure a course. I then navigated uploading content and creating assignments. As classes have begun, I am working on best practices for assessing and giving feedback through the platform.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> While I am still learning the ins and outs of Schoology, I can appreciate its benefits. Students appreciate having a common layout for each class and similar assignment structures. The drawbacks Iâ€™ve found on the teacher-end are the complex user interface and bugs. In some ways, I prefer other systems like Google Classroom.</p>

            <h2>3. Flipgrid</h2>
            <p><strong>Description:</strong> This fall, I was asked to give a presentation on Flipgrid for the faculty. I prepared a 30-minute interactive presentation, which gave the basics of the website and explored different ways to implement it in the classroom. Flipgrid is a site that allows teachers and students to create video discussion boards. The media recorder is built in the tool, so students just need an account and a link to get started. Since the first time many teachers met students this year was in a virtual environment, Flipgrid provides a great way to get to know them. Instead of just a name and an outdated school picture, the whole class can actually see and hear each other, which builds community.</p>

            <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> I received lots of positive feedback from coworkers who were excited to try this in their own online classrooms. I plan to start Flipgrid with my own students this coming week. While some have embraced online learning, other students are hesitant to turn on their webcams and engage in class. My hope is that through this website, students can use creativity to build a community with me, their teacher, and their peers.</p>
