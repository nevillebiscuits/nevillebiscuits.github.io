    <main><h2>Welcome to my online portfolio of learning technologies</h2>

<p>As a learner starting her ninth year of teaching, I have gained a number of experiences in the classroom. Through this portfolio, I hope to share these experiences especially in the field of technology. When I attended high school, our access to technology was a lab just off the library with two dozen Windows desktops. We wrote essays and burned them onto CDs. After graduating college, I came back to the same high school as a first-year teacher. In that short time, the school had launched forward, giving every student a laptop through a one-to-one initiative. I want this website to demonstrate what I have learned and successfully used in my classroom. Hopefully, other educators can learn from me as well.</p>
